# [Google's Business Communications: Java Client](https://github.com/google-business-communications/java-businesscommunications)

[Business Communications](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/reference/business-communications/rest) is an API for creating, managing, and launching agents for Google's Verified SMS and Business Messages platforms.

## Documentation

The documentation for the Business Commmunications API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/reference/business-communications/rest).

## Quickstart

### Before you begin

1.  [Register with Business Messages](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register).
1.  Once registered, follow the instructions to [enable the APIs for your project](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register#enable-api).

### Installing the client library

The Business Communications library is hosted on Maven central.
To use the library in your project, add the following to the dependencies section of your
projectâ€™s build.gradle.

```
repositories {
   mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
   compile group: 'com.google.apis', name: 'google-api-services-businesscommunications', version: '1.25.4'
}
```

If using maven, add the following to your pom.xml file.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.apis</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-api-services-businesscommunications</artifactId>
  <version>1.25.4</version>
</dependency>
```

### Using the client library

```java
/**
 * Initializes credentials used by the Business Communications API.
 *
 * @param credentialsFileLocation The location for the GCP service account key file.
 */
private static BusinessCommunications.Builder getBusinessCommunicationsBuilder(String credentialsFileLocation) {
  System.out.println("Initializing credentials for the Business Communications API.");

  BusinessCommunications.Builder builder = null;
  try {
    GoogleCredential credential = GoogleCredential
        .fromStream(
            BusinessCommunicationsApi.class.getResourceAsStream("/" + credentialsFileLocation));

    credential = credential.createScoped(Arrays.asList(
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/businesscommunications"));

    credential.refreshToken();

    HttpTransport httpTransport = GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport();
    JacksonFactory jsonFactory = JacksonFactory.getDefaultInstance();

    // Create instance of the Business Communications API
    builder = new BusinessCommunications
        .Builder(httpTransport, jsonFactory, null)
        .setApplicationName(credential.getServiceAccountProjectId());

    // Set the API credentials and endpoint
    builder.setHttpRequestInitializer(credential);
  } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }

  return builder;
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
  try {
    // Create client library reference
    BusinessCommunications.Builder builder = getBusinessCommunicationsBuilder("your-service-account-key-file-location");

  	// Create a request to create a new brand with the name "Test Brand"
    BusinessCommunications.Brands.Create request = builder
        .build().brands().create(new Brand().setDisplayName("Test Brand"));

    Brand brand = request.execute();

    // Print newly created brand object
    System.out.println(brand.toPrettyString());
  } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
}
```
